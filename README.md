# PieBot
a bot i may have made accidentally by learning how powerful kotlin actually is

(invite link coming soon)

bot is WIP and in beta, expect some bugs and a LOT of downtime. 

# how to host this yourself
first, create a file named bot_secrets.properties inside src/main/resources/conf. then, fill it in with these values:
```properties
token=YOUR.TOKEN.HERE
```

then, you should be good to go for the most part
