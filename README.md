# PieBot
a bot i may have made accidentally by learning how powerful kotlin actually is

discontinued bot, nothing more than really just a test bot

# how to host this yourself
first, create a file named bot_secrets.properties inside src/main/resources/conf. then, fill it in with these values:
```properties
token=YOUR.TOKEN.HERE
```

then, you should be good to go for the most part
